BCn (or DXTn if you prefer) is a very widely used texture compression scheme. _n_ denotes a specific variant for a particular use case (`RGB`, `RGB+A`, etc.). All variants offer a fixed-rate lossy compression which can be decompressed in hardware. In this post we'll focus on BC1, but the ideas are relevant to other variants.

## BC1 Overview

For a very nice reference on the all the BCn formats see [Nathan Reed's guide](http://www.reedbeta.com/blog/understanding-bcn-texture-compression-formats/). I'll cover the basics of BC1 here for completeness.

All the BC variants operate on 4x4 pixel blocks of image data. BC1 deals specifically with RGB color data, with an optional 1-bit alpha channel (more on that later).

![BC1 Block Example](/images/bc1-gpu/bc1_block_example.png)

Each compressed BC1 block stores two colors which are interpreted as the endpoints of a line segment in RGB space, plus sixteen 2-bit indices (one index per pixel in the block). These indices refer to one of four positions on the line segment - the two midpoints aren't stored but are interpolated between the endpoints during decompression.

The whole block is 8 bytes: 2 bytes for each line segment endpoint (encoded as RGB 5:6:5), 4 bytes for the indices (16x 2 bits):

![BC1 Block Layout](/images/bc1-gpu/bc1_block_layout.png)

_Note that the index values aren't ordered sequentially on the line segment. 0 and 1 are the endpoints, 2 and 3 are the interpolated midpoints! This slightly  complicates the encoding algorithm, as we'll see later. Perhaps there is a reason for doing it this way, but to me it looks like an oversight in the design._

### 1-bit Alpha

The encoding scheme described above can actually represent the same data in two different ways. If we swap the endpoints and invert the indices, we get a different bit pattern which represents the same data! BC1 exploits this degeneracy to represent a 1-bit alpha channel.

This works by interpreting the endpoints directly as 16-bit `uints`. `if (endpoint1 >= endpoint0)` then the block is interpreted as above, `if (endpoint1 < endpoint0)` then it is an 'alpha mode' block. In this mode only one interpolated midpoint is used instead of two. The spare index (0x3) is used to represent a black pixel with 0 alpha.

## Compression Algorithm

For each block we perform 3 steps:

1. Find the endpoints. The resulting line segment needs to be a reasonable fit for of all the data in the source block.
2. For each pixel in the source block, choose the most appropriate index.
3. Encode the block.

Because the blocks are compressed independently, the algorithm is trivial to parallelize. Performing it on the GPU is therefore a no-brainer. 

There are also an increasing number of use cases for compressing runtime-generated textures, for example caching complicated material blends or compositing large numbers of surface decals (3), therefore it is useful to have a high speed/lower quality path for this purpose.

### OpenGL

OpenGL doesn't allow us to alias compressed textures as render targets, or to bind them as images. We're therefore forced to write our results to a shader storage buffer and then call `glCompressedTextureSubImage2D()` to move the data from the buffer to the texture resource, which incurs a small overhead.

## Implementation

For the rest of this post I'll focus on a compute shader implementation which performs the compression of a single 4x4 block. We'll dispatch one thread group per block with one thread per texel (=16 threads per group).

### 0. Load Source Data

We'll be accessing the data in the source block multiple times during the compression, so the first step is to load it into group shared memory for fast access.

{% highlight glsl %}
uniform sampler2D txSrc;
shared vec3 s_srcBlock[16];

void main()
{
	#define TEXEL_INDEX (gl_LocalInvocationIndex)
	#define TEXEL_COORD (gl_LocalInvocationID.xy)
	#define BLOCK_INDEX (gl_WorkGroupID.y * gl_NumWorkGroups.x + gl_WorkGroupID.x)
	#define BLOCK_COORD (gl_WorkGroupID.xy * 4)

	ivec2 iuv = ivec2(BLOCK_COORD + TEXEL_COORD);
	s_srcBlock[TEXEL_INDEX] = texelFetch(txSrc, iuv, 0).rgb;
	groupMemoryBarrier();
}
{% endhighlight %}

### 1. Find the Endpoints

#### Color Space Bounds

The fastest approach is simply to find the bounding box of the source block in RGB space. The endpoints are the min and max extents of the box:

{% highlight glsl %}
vec3 ep0, ep1;
ep0 = ep1 = s_srcBlock[0];
for (int i = 1; i < 16; ++i) {
	ep0 = min(ep0, s_srcBlock[i]);
	ep1 = max(ep1, s_srcBlock[i]);
}
{% endhighlight %}

![BC1 Bounding Box Good](/images/bc1-gpu/bc1_bounding_box.png)

This is fast and the quality is usually good enough (especially for runtime compression). However, there are cases (usually in areas of high color contrast) where it's a very poor approximation. Consider the situation below:

![BC1 Bounding Box Bad](/images/bc1-gpu/bc1_bounding_box2.png)

Clearly in this case the line segment formed by the min/max bounding box extents isn't representative of the data in the source block. 

#### PCA

A more accurate (but more costly) method is to use principle component analysis (PCA). 

### 2. Find the Indices

For each pixel in the source block, we need to find the nearest endpoint on the block's line segment in RGB space. A naive approach would be to loop over each endpoint to find the index with the minimum error (min Euclidean distance). A more efficient solution is to project each source texel onto the block's line segment and round up or down to the nearest endpoint:

![BC1 Projection](/images/bc1-gpu/bc1_endpoint_project.png)

Another way to think of this is that we are minimizing the error between the source texel and the final decoded texel by finding the 'best match' in our 4 color palette. Note that it is important to quantize the palette such that the values are the same as they will be when the block is decoded, further reducing error.

(2) points out that it is probably better to minimize straight RGB error rather than 'perceptual' error, since most textures aren't rendered directly but are instead used as inputs to a BRDF (albedo, roughness, etc.). 

{% highlight glsl %}
// quantize endpoints to minimize final error
ep0 = UnpackRGB565(PackRGB565(ep0));
ep1 = UnpackRGB565(PackRGB565(ep1));

// project onto (ep1 - ep0)
vec3 d = ep1 - ep0;
float dlen = length(d);
d = d / dlen;
vec3 src = s_srcBlock[TEXEL_INDEX];
float idx = dot(src - ep0, d) / dlen;

// round to nearest index
idx = round(saturate(idx) * 3.0);
const uvec4 idxMap = uvec4(1, 3, 2, 0); // BCn index ordering is non-sequential
s_indices[TEXEL_INDEX] = idxMap[uint(idx)];

groupMemoryBarrier();
{% endhighlight %}

_Note the use of `idxMap` to swizzle the final index. This is due to way BCn blocks arrange the endpoint indices as mentioned earlier._ 

### 3. Encode the Block

Once the endpoints and indices are found, we're ready to encode the block and write it to the destination buffer:

{% highlight glsl %}
if (TEXEL_INDEX == 0) { // use 1 thread from the group
	uvec2 block = uvec2(0);

 // pack endpoints in bits [0,31]
	block[0] = bitfieldIndsert(block[0], PackRGB565(ep1), 0,  16));
	block[0] = bitfieldIndsert(block[0], PackRGB565(ep0), 16, 16));

 // pack indices in bits [32,63]
	for (int i = 0; i < 16; ++i) {
		block[1] = bitfieldInsert(block[1], s_indices[i], i * 2, 2);
	}
	
 // write block data
	bfDst[BLOCK_INDEX] = block;
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Optimization

### Solid Color Blocks

The astute reader may have noticed that there is a potential divide-by-zero in the index search: `d = d / dlen`. In this case `dlen` might be zero if the endpoints are the same, which happens when a block is a solid color. If we detect this case we can early-out of the algorithm as an optimization, which also neatly avoids the DBZ.


TODO NOTES
- Don't need to swap indices for min/max method because ep1 is always going to be > ep0.
- Shift the bounding box center to the average position of the sample points and shrink it a bit?
- (2) Also explains how to do the degeneracy for alpha.

- Notes about the specular F term.
	- Using shiny balls to verify against ground truth is misleading.
	- Real surfaces have complex macroscopic detail which is lost when downsampling normal maps for mipmapping.
	- Bias roughness maps?
	- Modified F90 (as per Frostbite).

- Complex materials like cloth/grass not well represented, specular F term is again at the heart of the issue.
	- Separate BRDF for these types of materials?
	- Some exhibit colored specular, can use the existing BRDF and blend f0 to the albedo color at very high roughness.
